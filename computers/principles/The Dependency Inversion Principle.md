The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.

In his [article](https://fi.ort.edu.uy/innovaportal/file/2032/1/design_principles.pdf) (2000), Uncle Bob summarizes this principle as follows:

> "If the OCP states the goal of OO architecture, the DIP states the primary mechanism".

These two principles are indeed related and we have applied this pattern before while we were discussing the Open-Closed Principle.

We want our classes to be open to extension, so we have reorganized our dependencies to depend on interfaces instead of concrete classes. Our PersistenceManager class depends on InvoicePersistence instead of the classes that implement that interface.
