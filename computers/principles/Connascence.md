Connascence is a software quality metric that describes different levels and dimensions of coupling. Two components are connascent if a change in one would require a change in the other as well. Lower connascence means higher code quality.

- Why

	- Reducing connascence will reduce the cost of change for a software system.
	- Arguably one of the most important benefits of connascence is that it gives developers a vocabulary to talk about different types of coupling.

- How

	- Each instance of connascence in a codebase is considered on 3 separate axes: strength, degree and locality.
	- It provides a system for comparing different types of dependency.
